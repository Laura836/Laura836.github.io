        <h3> History </h3>
        <p> This recipe originates from Puebla, Mexico where many other famous dishes were created. The recipe consists of mainly shredded chicken and a tostada. The tostado was made in Oaxaca, Mexico. When tortillas lost their freshness and became too stiff to fold they didn't want to waste them so they ate them hard, to then call them tostadas. They got the name from what they were. Tostada translates to toasted.</p>
